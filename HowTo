How to show and hide form fields based on the value of another field.

In the example below, the field (in step 1) is a select list.  When the user selects the "approve" value
specific fields should show in the form.  If the user selects anything else, those same fields should be hidden.

1) In the field whose value will be examined, use something like the following code in the "onchange" event

(function() {
	var currVal = field.getValue();
	if (currVal == "approver") {
		field.fireEvent("showApproverFields")
	} else {
		field.fireEvent("hideApproverFields")	}
})();

2) In each field you want to hide or show, create an event named "showApproverFields" with the code: 
field.show().  

Also create an event named "hideApproverFields" with the code: 
field.hide()
